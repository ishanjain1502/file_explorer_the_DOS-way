# file_explorer_the_DOS-way
/* So this is basically a program of a file explorer of the kind it used to be there on a DOS system, this is a kind of inspired from that; it works on the same principle as the on on MS DOS .
It uses a file allocation table(FAT) to store the all the files, and it also has a file control block(FCB) which is created individually for each fle.
For utilising this program you need to first create file inside this , and there after you can perform all sorts of operations over it, it does not contain the literal file but a mere space for what it occupies.
This program just shows you how it works inside the computer system.
PS - It's a file explorer not an editor.
